I just graduated from Princeton University with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering in [Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) in May 2024. Here, I was fortunate to be advised by [Ludovic Tangpi](https://ludovic.princeton.edu/). My current research interests lie in stochastic analysis (and, in general, financial math), reinforcement learning as well as generative AI.
